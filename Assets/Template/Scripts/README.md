<h2>Coin Collector</h2>

<p>
In this game, the user collects the coin and tries not to fall from the ground. 
The coin is just extra points, so even if the user does not collect any coins, 
it does not matter that much but they should be able to stay on the ground and 
not fall. If the user falls, the game is over and it shows a button saying to 
restart again. If the user reaches to the end, a new scene is displayed which 
says the user has won.
</p>

<p>
In order to start, the user needs to press on the start button, which prompts 
them to another scene where they can play the game. The user can use the arrow
keys to go forward, backward, left and right. In order to jump, they need to 
press the space bar. If they fall and 'Game Over' is displayed, there is 
another button 'Restart', which restarts the game from the start.
